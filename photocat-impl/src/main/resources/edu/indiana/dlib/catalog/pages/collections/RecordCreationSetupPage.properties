title:Collection Record Creation Setup

description-record:Creation of new records in photocat is essential to being able to use a collection configuration.  Unless data is pre-loaded, one of three methods for record identifier creation must be selected.  

recFs:Record Creation
idGenFs:Generated IDs
generator:IDs generated from external service
specFs:User Specified IDs
specified:IDs are specified by the application user
autoFs:Auto-generated IDs
auto:IDs are generated automatically using numeric incrementation


idGenUrl:ID Generator URL
idGenPrefix:ID Prefix (the ID from the generator is appended to this)
idPattern:Pattern for ID specification
idNumberFile:ID number file
idNumberFormat:ID number format
idNumberPrefix:ID prefix (the formatted number is appended to this)

description-image:Image submission requires configuration as well.  The only mechanism currently supported depends on an external asynchronous image procesing service.  To hook into that service, this collection must be configured to point to the dropbox directory into which new image files will be submitted and the directory into which output files will be located.  The directories must exist and must be configured with the image processing, archival and fedora ingest systems.

imageFs:Image Submission
dropboxDir:Submission Dropbox Directory
toFedoraDir:Ingest Dropbox Directory

number-file-does-not-exist:The number file containing the integer part of the next id, does not exist!
dropbox-dir-does-not-exist:The specified submission dropbox directory does not exist!
to-fedora-dir-does-not-exist:The specified ingest dropbox directory does not exist!

malformed-url:The specified URL is not valid!
invalidCombination:"Configuration must contain either ("idGenerationUrl" and "idPrefix") or "idPattern" or ("idNumberFile", "idDigits" and "idPrefix")!"
