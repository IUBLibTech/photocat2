This is the photocat cataloging application.

The current build scripts build a dummy version of the application that
has all local/embedded implementations.  Its only purpose is to demonstrate
the application running locally.

To perform this demonstration:

1.  Run the war-webapp ant task
2.  set the PHOTOCAT_HOME environment variable to point to the 
    "conf/dummy/repository" directory in the source tree.
3.  Deploy the build war file "dist/dummy/photocat2.war" into
    tomcat or a compatible servlet container.
    
To integrate this application with your system or repository:
